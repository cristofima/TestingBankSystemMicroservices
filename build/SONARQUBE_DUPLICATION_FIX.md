# SonarQube File Duplication Fix - Final Resolution

## Issue Summary

The SonarQube analysis was failing with the error:

```
The file 'DependencyInjection.cs' is already indexed with key...
```

This occurred because files were being indexed both as source code and test code due to overlapping inclusion/exclusion patterns.

## Root Cause

The original configuration had both `sonar.sources` and `sonar.tests` pointing to the same root directory (`src/services`), causing all files to be indexed twice - once as source and once as test files.

**Original problematic configuration:**

```properties
sonar.sources=src/services
sonar.tests=src/services              # Same root directory!
sonar.test.inclusions=**/tests/**/*  # Trying to filter with inclusions
```

## Solution Applied

**Fixed configuration:**

### sonar-project.properties

```properties
# Source code settings - exclude test directories
sonar.sources=src/services
sonar.exclusions=**/bin/**/*,**/obj/**/*,**/Migrations/**/*,**/*.Designer.cs,**/ModelSnapshot.cs,**/Program.cs,**/tests/**/*

# Test settings - only test directories
sonar.tests=src/services/Security/tests,src/services/Account/tests,src/services/Movement/tests,src/services/Transaction/tests
sonar.test.inclusions=**/*Test*.cs,**/*Tests.cs
sonar.test.exclusions=**/bin/**/*,**/obj/**/*
```

### Pipeline YAML

```yaml
extraProperties: |
  sonar.sources=src/services
  sonar.exclusions=**/bin/**/*,**/obj/**/*,**/Migrations/**/*,**/*.Designer.cs,**/ModelSnapshot.cs,**/Program.cs,**/tests/**/*
  sonar.tests=src/services/Security/tests,src/services/Account/tests,src/services/Movement/tests,src/services/Transaction/tests
  sonar.test.inclusions=**/*Test*.cs,**/*Tests.cs
  sonar.test.exclusions=**/bin/**/*,**/obj/**/*
```

## Key Changes

1. **Added `**/tests/**/\*`to`sonar.exclusions`** - This ensures NO test directories are included in source code analysis
2. **Changed `sonar.tests` to explicit test directory paths** - Instead of using the same root directory, explicitly list each test directory
3. **Updated `sonar.test.inclusions`** - Simplified pattern to match test files more accurately
4. **Synchronized pipeline and properties file** - Both configurations now match exactly

## Result

- ✅ No more file duplication errors
- ✅ Clear separation between source and test code
- ✅ SonarQube analysis can complete successfully
- ✅ Coverage and test results properly indexed

## Files Modified

1. `sonar-project.properties` - Fixed file path configurations
2. `build/azure-pipelines/ci-build-test.yml` - Updated SonarQube extraProperties
3. `build/SONARQUBE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation with fix and troubleshooting

This fix ensures that SonarQube can properly distinguish between source code and test code, preventing the file duplication issue that was causing analysis failures.
